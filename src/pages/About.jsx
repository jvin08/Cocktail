      <p>So summer’s almost over and you didn’t have a getaway yet — sorry, going to Rio de Janeiro via your TV and Olympics viewing party doesn’t count. Before you put on your sad face, there’s still time to experience the ultimate staycation. The whole point of travel is to step out of your daily routine, relax and explore new things, right? Well, you don’t have to be in another land to do that. Just pick a country and immerse yourself by looking at travel guides, slideshows and videos; reading works of fiction with settings so realistic, you feel you’re there and filling your Prime watch list with films in foreign languages. And while you’re doing all that, sip a national drink or two.</p>
